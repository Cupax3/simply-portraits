## No-nonsense Chat Portraits for Foundry VTT

There are a couple mods that add chat portraits to chat messages in FVTT.
Typically they come with lots of options. This mod has a single option.
Typically chat portrait mods have hundreds or even thousands of lines of code,
and can be hard to fix when they break. This mod has ~75 lines of code and is
trivial to keep up-to-date.

That's it. That's the mod.
